# Milestone 1 — Closure Checklist

**Date:** 2025-08-16  
**Owner:** Jaime Vela Rodrigo

## Completed
- Pillar Specs unified (EN):
  - Renaissance → `specs/renaissance/current/spec.yaml` + summary_en.md
  - Professional → `specs/professional/current/spec.yaml` (+ CF)
  - Foresight   → `specs/foresight/current/spec.yaml` (+ CF)
- Repo documented in README (AI grounding instructions).
- Single source of truth = this repo.

## Pending for M2
- Complete `core/spec-core.yaml` fully (identity, offers, contexts).
- Keep `core/spec-core.md` short, in English.
- Prepare Custom GPT and Hybrid setup.

## Notes
Repo is AI-ready: AIs should read `core/spec-core.yaml` first, then the active pillar YAML, and end with Action (3 steps ≤ 7 days).
