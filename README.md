# Specs2Action

**Specs2Action** is a repository to unify Jaime Vela Rodrigo’s Specs (Renaissance, Professional, Foresight) into a coherent structure readable by both **humans** and **AI**.

## Purpose
- Provide a **machine-readable identity** (`core/spec-core.yaml`) that links to each Spec.
- Document each Spec in **YAML + JSON + Markdown** so it can be used for:
  - AI copilots / custom GPTs
  - Public sharing (LinkedIn, talks, docs)
  - Strategic or financial decision support

## Structure
- `core/` → identity spec (root coherence layer).
- `spec/renaissance/` → Spec Renaissance (personal essence).
- `spec/professional/` → Spec Professional (corporate finance & practice).
- `spec/foresight/` → Spec Foresight (poetic discernment + investable guardrails).

## Milestones
- **M1 (Aug 2025):** Specs unified, CF-enhanced, repo structured, closure checklist done.
- **M2:** Build `spec-core.yaml` fully + Custom GPT pilot.
- **M3:** Publish selected outputs to LinkedIn + external docs.

## Next Steps
1. Complete `core/spec-core.yaml` (identity + coherence map).
2. Create Custom GPT that always references `core` + active spec.
3. Use Specs for content creation (LinkedIn posts, proposals, talks).
