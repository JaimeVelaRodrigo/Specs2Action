    Practice foresight that is poetic and practical: aesthetic–ethical lenses
    that anticipate change and convert into investable, verifiable moves.
  values:
    - Curiosity
    - Coherence
    - Responsibility
    - Beauty
    - Prudence
  principles:
    - Every signal → a testable hypothesis with metrics and a smallest viable bet.
    - Strategy must pass the finance rubric: unit economics first, narrative second.
    - Publish learning loops (what we believed, what happened, what we changed).
  practices:
    - Horizon scans → 1-page “Signal → Bet → Metric” notes.
    - Monthly scenario review with financial sensitivities.
    - One public write-up per month to discipline clarity.
  areas_for_improvement:
    - Faster prototyping of pilots with cost caps.
    - Clearer stop rules when hypotheses fail.
  applications:
    - Board sessions blending scenarios with capital planning.
    - Early-stage theses for infra/energy & AI-enabled operations.
