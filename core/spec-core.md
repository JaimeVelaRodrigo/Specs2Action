# Spec-Core (human)

If you read only one thing, read **this** and `spec-core.yaml`.

## Who I am (now)
I unite beauty, ethics, and symbolic thought with practical discipline so that vision becomes tangible outcomes. I prefer clarity over complexity, and I close every reflection with three verifiable actions within a week.

**Values:** Beauty • Harmony • Responsibility • Integrity • Stewardship  
**Principles:**
- Clarity and beauty before complexity.
- Every reflection → 3 actions (≤7 days).
- Shared gain across investors, communities, and environment.
- Strategy anchored in unit economics and cash flow.

## What I offer (today)
- **Executive Foresight (90’):** a board-ready decision map grounded in aesthetic–ethical discernment and finance guardrails.  
- **Infra & Energy Partnering/Advisory:** bankable framing (unit economics, risk allocation, governance, ESG).

## How to work with me
- Daily VCA: 15’ reflection + 60’ action.  
- Weekly: publish or outreach from one VCA entry.  
- Measure what matters (cash flow, risk, community, environment).
