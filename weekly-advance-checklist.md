# Weekly Advance Checklist — Specs2Action

Before advancing this week, verify:

- [ ] Is there a clearly stated key inquiry?
- [ ] Do I know who or what to engage to answer it?
- [ ] Is the expected evidence defined (sufficient, not perfect)?
- [ ] Does the answer enable a concrete decision?
- [ ] Am I avoiding action driven purely by anxiety or narrative pressure?
- [ ] Does this step preserve capital, reputation, and vital energy?

If any answer is NO → do not advance.
